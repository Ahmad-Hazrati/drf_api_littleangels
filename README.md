# Little Angels
Little Angles is designed to be a social platform for the parents to get together and collaborate with each others. The primary goals of the web are to:
1. Provide parents the ability to share the picture of their little ones with others and make it an unforgetable memory for themselves;
2. Act as an hub for parents to get informed about the events and social activities and book one.
3. Provide a simple and inituitive user experience for parents to use.
4. Offers a minimal set of impactful features chosen in order to deliver a useful app within achieveable development timeframe, while laying a solid foundation for additional features in the future.

The site is showcasing Python (DRF framework), JavaScript (React library), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL database, Herokuapp, and Gitpod for Project Portfolio 5.
