# Little Angels

This project is designed and developed to create a better user experience for the users/ parents. The users can register and log in to the site, view and post about their little angels, comment and like/unlike a post,  view published events and book an event and view the number of followers and  the events posted by the admin/community responsible person. The users are also able to register for events, like and comment on an event, and edit and delete their comments. The functionality of category & profile pages and search bar are also added for user convenience and better user experience.

The website is created for real-life situations but embedded with fictitious data for checking purposes. The site is showcasing Python (Django framework), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL database, Herokuapp, and Gitpod for Project Portfolio 4.
